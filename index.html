<p>This will be a multiplayer PacMan game.  Currently it is very much a work in progress and is non-functional.</p>
<p>When you first connect the ghost icon that appears in the upper left corner of the browser is what ghost you are able to control.  The arrow keys, wasd, or hjkl can be used to try to control the ghost.  They must keep moving and they can not reverse their direction.  Once you have mastered controlling a ghost try being PacMan by pressing the p key.</p>
